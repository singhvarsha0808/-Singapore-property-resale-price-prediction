# Singapore Property Resale Price Prediction

## About <a name = "about"></a>

In the Singapore housing market, home ownership is an expensive financial decision for most people. Buyers are concerned with finding the best value for their money, while sellers and real estate agents aim to maximize their profits. The government also faces the challenge of providing affordable housing due to the limited amount of available land. This is why a deeper understanding of the housing market is crucial for all stakeholders.

This poject focuses on predicting the asking prices of properties in Singapore through regression analysis. The project involves the justification, derivation, and evaluation of different features to train the regressor. The outcome will not only provide a dollar value prediction, but also reveal the importance of different attributes, comparisons of regression techniques, error analysis, and discussions on limitations and potential extensions.
